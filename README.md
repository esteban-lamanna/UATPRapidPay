Assumptions due lack of time:
  - fee is fixed between 0 and 2.
  - i could't write all validations.
  - Logic could be in a separate project.
  - 

You can use this connection string: "Data Source=(LocalDb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Initial Catalog=RapidPay_PreviousMigrations;Integrated Security=SSPI"
and then run update-database.
